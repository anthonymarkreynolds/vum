# VUM
## Vim Unimproved
This is recreational project where I'm building a vim clone in javascript. The aim of this project is to use a single dom elements text node as the entire user interface.

## Currently working
- resize display
- status line
- last pressed char info

## Sort of working
- insert mode
- cursor navigation

## Todo
- write todo list
